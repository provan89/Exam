    <div class="science">Community Science Museum</div>
    <div class="Community">
        <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
            understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies
            far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>
        <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone
            can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion
            to continue the exploration of the world around us.</p>
        <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook,
            but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied
            subjects
            of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see
            science
            come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
        </p>

    <div class="explore">Explore for kids</div>
    <div class="kids">
        <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum,
            there’s plenty to see and do.</p>
        <p>You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back
            in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits
            are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.</p>
        <p>We
            also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between
            10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.</p>
        <p>During
            the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go
            on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about
            the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.</p>

    <div class="teachers">For teachers</div>
    <div class="teach">
        <p>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
            create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students
            guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide great
            video presentations that will excite and inspire them.
            Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities
            and to arrange a time to bring your students through for a visit.
            Researchers</p>
        <p>Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers
            and academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our resources
            and contribute towards them. We have online records, laboratory space, and
            a working relationship with a number of universities around the country.

    <div class="cosmology">Cosmology</div>
    <div class="cosmo">
        <p>
            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
            ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us
            We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a
            bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s
            telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

    <div class="evolution">Evolution</div>
    <div class="centur">
        <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where
            do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
            framework
            for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can
            also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
            Dodos,
            and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

    <div class="biology">Biology and Medicine</div>
    <div class="medicine">
        <p>From micro-organisms to the human body,
            major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
        <p>For
            many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
            growth
            of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a
            look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
            heart transplant.</p>
        <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from
            the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our
            fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

    <div class="AI">
        <p>The information revolution is here and robotics
            and artificial intelligence are the science of the future.
            From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of
            robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and
            shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

    <div class="ecology">Ecology</div>
    <div class="learn">
        <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that
            scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming,
            extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a
            brighter future.</p>

    <div class="loan">
        <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
            Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements
            as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able
            to use and control wind to create power.</p>
